            <h2>I'am Khilu Sen, a HairStylish</h2>
            <p>
           Master Barber and owner of The Hair Zone Barbar shop. I have had a passion for cutting hair since I was 16, 
            where I began practicing on my friends and family, and continue to cut their hair to this day.
            where I became a Master Barber. I worked at C&C Hair Design for 3 years, and Heads Up Main Street in Mt. Kisco for the past 10 years. 
            I truly enjoy the traditional feel of a Barbershop, and love creating that experience for my clients, making each one walk out feeling like a new man. I specialize in scissor cuts as well as in hot towel, straight razor shaves, which makes any man feel amazing and brings back the root of barbering.
